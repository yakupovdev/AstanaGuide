                <h3>Khan Shatyr</h3>
                <p>Khan Shatyr is one of the most recognizable symbols of modern Astana and the world's largest tent,
                    designed by renowned architect Norman Foster. Its unusual shape and size have made the building an
                    architectural landmark of the capital.<br>
                    <br>
                    Inside Khan Shatyr is a shopping and entertainment center with dozens of shops, restaurants,
                    cinemas, and recreation areas. The complex's special pride is its indoor water park with a tropical
                    climate and an artificial beach, where even in winter a summer atmosphere is maintained with sand
                    brought from the Maldives.<br>
                    <br>
                    The complex often hosts city festivals, concerts, and exhibitions. Thanks to its combination of
                    innovative architecture and diverse entertainment, Khan Shatyr is deservedly considered a “city
                    within a city” and a favorite leisure destination for residents and visitors to Astana.

                <h3>Baiterek</h3>
                <p>Baiterek is the main attraction and symbol of Astana, reflecting the ideas of independence and
                    development of Kazakhstan. The tower rises to a height of 97 meters, symbolizing the year when the
                    capital was moved to Astana.<br>
                    <br>
                    At the top, there is an observation deck with a panoramic view of the entire city. The First
                    President's “palm print” is also kept here, which has become a popular tradition for tourists and
                    residents.<br>
                    <br>
                    The architecture of Baiterek is symbolic: the golden ball at the top represents an ancient legend
                    about the world tree and the sacred bird Samruk, which lays an egg in its branches.
                    <br>
                    Today, Baiterek is not only a tourist attraction, but also a meeting place, a venue for cultural
                    events, and one of the most photographed places in the capital.
