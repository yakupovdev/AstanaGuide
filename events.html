                <h3>Vienna Strauss Philharmonie Orchestra</h3>
                <b style="font-size: 25px;">October 20 2025</b>
                <p>For the first time in its history, the Vienna Strauss Philharmonie Orchestra is going on tour in
                    Kazakhstan and will perform concerts in Almaty and Astana.<br>
                    <br>
                    The program includes the best works of world classics — masterpieces by Mozart, Brahms, Haydn,
                    Dvořák, Rossini, as well as legendary waltzes and polkas by the great Strauss dynasty, whose name is
                    inextricably linked with Vienna.<br>
                    <br>  
                    The orchestra consists of 27 musicians from different countries around the world: Austria, Hungary,
                    Japan, Ukraine, Germany, Poland, Taiwan, Croatia, and Cyprus. Each of them was carefully selected by
                    an expert jury for this special tour.<br>
                    <br>
                    The main mission of the ensemble is to preserve and develop Viennese musical culture and promote it
                    in Europe and on the international stage. The concert in Astana will be a highlight of the fall,
                    where the audience will be able to enjoy the energy of Viennese traditions and feel the spirit of
                    true classical Vienna.</p>
